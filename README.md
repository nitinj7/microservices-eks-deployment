## Overview

This repository contains code and configurations to deploy a simple microservices application to AWS EKS. The project includes:
- Containerized microservices for frontend, backend, and database.
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store Docker images.
- A CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate image building, pushing, and deployment to EKS.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Static files served via NGINX.
- **Backend**: REST API service.
- **Database**: MySQL for data persistence.
- **CI/CD**: Automated using GitHub Actions, with GitHub Secrets for secure access to AWS.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS EKS**: Managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications.
- **Docker**: Containerization of microservices.
- **Amazon ECR**: Repository to store and manage Docker images.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration for deployment, scaling, and management.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation for continuous deployment.
- **CloudWatch & Prometheus**: Monitoring and logging tools.
